# AUTOMATED-ESSAY-SCORING
An android app that can automatically score english essays. built using flutter, python and flask framework.

### Background

The Hewlett Foundation has provided a set of high school student essays along with scores generated by human expert graders. The initial data was released in 2012<sup>1</sup> as part of a Kaggle competition to produce an automated student assessment algorithm to closely match the human scores. Scores are evaluated with the quadratic weighted kappa error metric, which measures the agreement between two raters.


### Approach

A supervised approach  using machine learning on extracted features, such as named entities, syntax or labelled dependencies.

The training data contains about 1700 essays for each of 8 topics and about 500 essay for an eighth topic. Essays are either source dependent responses or persuasive/narrative/expository on a given topic. The code is executed across three notebooks:

[1 EDA](Exploratory data analysis.ipynb)

[2 Feature Selection](Feature Selection.ipynb)

[3 Machine Learning with PCA](Final_model_with_Pca+learning_Carves.ipynb)
